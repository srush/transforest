"</seg>
<seg id="170">experts think this is a groundless accusation against china 's normal national defense construction . it plays up " china military threat " and interferes in china 's internal affairs .</seg>
<seg id="171">the quadrennial defense review is the pentagon 's new national defense guideline document .</seg>
<seg id="172">the 92 @-@ page @-@ long report devoted three paragraphs to commenting on china 's military issues and the countermeasures the united states should take . directly mentioning the two phrases of " china " or " chinese " 15 times , the report said that " as a major and emerging power , china has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the united states . if the united states does not have countermeasures , china will very likely develop disruptive military technologies so as to destroy us advantages in conventional weapons . "</seg>
<seg id="173">yao yunzhu , a research fellow from the department of world military studies of the chinese military academy of sciences , said that though senior us officials expressed similar views on various occasions earlier , this is the first time the united states proposed in its " national defense strategy report " that " china is an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the united states .

<seg id="176">noticeably , on the same day the quadrennial defense review was officially submitted , us president bush also submitted a government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to congress , with the national defense budget at 439.3 billion us dollars .</seg>
<seg id="177">" if the additional budget for military operations in iraq and afghanistan is added , the us national defense budget for 2007 fiscal year will go beyond the milestone of 500 billion dollars , an all time high , " peng guangqian said . " that is almost equal to the sum of the military spending of all the other countries in the world . "</seg>
<seg id="178">peng guanqian thinks that the fabrication of " foreign threats " by the united states reflected the pentagon 's habitual style of " making enemies " and that its real purpose is to secure more national defense funds so that the huge us arms industry groups can fish for more profits .</seg>
<seg id="179">experts said that compared with huge military expenditures of the united states , china 's national defense expenditures are quite limited .</seg>
<seg id="180">deng hongzhou , a military expert who has participated several times in drafting the white papers on china 's national defense , said that china 's defense expenditures have somewhat increased with economic development since the 1990 s , but the proportion it takes in the state national budget for the same period is on the decline .</seg>
<seg id="181">official statistics show that compared with 1979 , the proportion of china 's expenditures for national defense in 2004 in the state budget for the same period dropped by nearly 10 percentage points .</seg>
<seg id="182">in 2005 china 's expenditures for national defense was 244.656 billion rmb , only about 1 @/@ 14 of that of the united states . its military expenditure per capita was about 1 @/@ 60 of that of the united states , and its military funding per soldier was about 1 @/@ 30 of that of a us soldier .</seg>
<seg id="183">" the united states is equal to china in terms of territorial area , but there is such a big difference in military expenditures . it is self @-@ evident whose military power is beyond normal defense needs . "</seg>
<seg id="184">peng guangqian said .</seg>
<seg id="185">teng jianqun , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the united states should evaluate china 's military construction situation objectively and that china 's peaceful development doesn't necessarily mean that china and the united states will become military antagonists in the future .</seg>
<seg id="186">china 's 2004 white paper on national defense says that china firmly adheres to the path of peaceful development and adopts a national defense policy that is defensive in nature .</seg>

<seg id="210">xinhua news agency correspondents wang hao and huang min</seg>
<seg id="211">after the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the legislative council elections , how to draw up a blueprint for a new government has become the current focus of international attention .</seg>
<seg id="212">what new policies hamas will push for will directly impact the direction of subsequent corresponding policies by the various parties to the peace process .</seg>
<seg id="213">in the meantime , resistance by the us and israel will add to the uncertainty about the prospects of the hamas government .</seg>
<seg id="214">at present , various parties in palestine are accelerating consultations and actively seeking breakthroughs on difficulties and sensitive points regarding future developments involved in forming the cabinet .</seg>
<seg id="215">( subtitle ) who will become prime minister ?</seg>
<seg id="216">after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , some outsiders worried that disagreements could occur between " prime minister hamas " and current top leader abbas .</seg>
<seg id="217">in addition , hamas leader mashal , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government led and formed by hamas will not recognize israel . this strong message also increased international concern .</seg>
<seg id="218">the us and israel explicitly said that they would not accept a hamas government which possesses actual power , threatening to discontinue economic aid and tax transfers to palestine .</seg>
<seg id="219">however , this did not hinder hamas from making a flexible tactical adjustment , selecting an independent individual as a compromise .</seg>
<seg id="220">according to reports , in order to obtain maximum international recognition , hamas leaders both at home and abroad , who recently gathered in egypt , decided to select independent jamal al @-@ khudairi , board chairman of the islamic university in gaza , as new prime minister .</seg>
<seg id="221">the move has yet to receive responses from relevant parties .</seg>
<seg id="222">palestinian analyst hussein said that no matter who becomes prime minister , the key is that the prime minister nominee should try to downplay the hard @-@ line stance of hamas . only in this way can success in forming a cabinet be ensured .</seg>
<seg id="223">( subtitle ) how to divide power ?</seg>
<seg id="224">internally , the biggest challenge hamas faces in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance .</seg>
<seg id="225">an article carried in the palestinian newspaper al @-@ ayyam analyzed that although hamas won popularity through its social welfare programs , it lacks experience in governance . it would be wise for it to cooperate with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has experience in governance .</seg>
<seg id="226">following the elections , hamas proposed establishing a " political partnership " with fatah so as to jointly form a national coalition government . however , fatah has not responded enthusiastically so far .</seg>
<seg id="227">fatah is currently divided internally with regards to joining the cabinet . one faction advocates joining the new government so as to make some kind of move , while another faction rejects the hamas invitation , preferring to be an " active opposition " in the legislative council .</seg>
<seg id="228">sources noted that under abbas 's persuasion , fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government .</seg>
<seg id="229">in spite of this , hamas and fatah will still bargain over the distribution of cabinet positions .</seg>
<seg id="230">in addition , another approach is to form a cabinet outside the framework of the legislative council , breaking away from partisan affiliations .</seg>
<seg id="231">according to reports , hamas has designed a government exclusively composed of experts , but the specific name list is unknown .</seg>
<seg id="232">based on us and israeli attitudes , forming a government composed of technical experts would also be a good way to relieve outside pressure .</seg>
<seg id="233">according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law , after the new legislative council assumes power on the 16 th of this month , the nomination of the prime minister and formation of the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .</seg>
<seg id="234">( subtitle ) what about arms ?</seg>
<seg id="235">the weapons it possesses is another tough issue hamas faces in forming the new government .</seg>
<seg id="236">the us and israel are very firm in their positions , resolutely demanding that hamas abandon violence and rejecting its armed participation in the government .</seg>
<seg id="237">hamas leader mashal stressed on the 9 th that armed resistance is a " strategic choice " of the organization .</seg>
<seg id="238">the issue of weapons actually exists on two levels , the legitimacy of arms and the affiliation and administration of armed forces .</seg>
<seg id="239">hamas won international recognition by being elected the top major party in the legislative council through democratic and free methods . the way to similarly legalize its subordinate armed faction az a @-@ din al @-@ qassam brigades is to integrate it into government security institutions .</seg>
<seg id="240">hamas had previously proposed unifying armed forces of all factions into a " people 's army " of the palestinian national authority , yet failed to get widespread response and was criticized by the palestinian islamic jihad ( jihad ) .</seg>
<seg id="241">at present , palestine has more than 60,000 security agency personnel , most of whom come from the fatah camp .</seg>
<seg id="242">in addition , fatah has some loosely organized subordinate armed factions , such as al @-@ aqsa martyrs ' brigades and the fatah hawks .</seg>
<seg id="243">hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must reach a consensus with abbas as to how to manage these autonomous armed forces and reasonably divide administrative power .</seg>
<seg id="244">according to local media reports , abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence forces , while leaving agencies such as the police and civil defense under the administration of the interior ministry of the new government .</seg>
<seg id="245">however , the various parties are still negotiating over this sensitive issue , with no outcome so far .</seg>

<seg id="328">xinhua news agency , tokyo , feb. 13 ( correspondent qian zheng ) researchers at japan 's tokai university have developed a type of bio @-@ artificial kidney , which not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney , but also the function of preserving useful substances . in addition it is small in size and easy to transplant . with further research , there is hope it will bring good news to kidney patients .</seg>
<seg id="329">according to a recent nikkei business daily report , the newly @-@ developed bio @-@ artificial kidney mainly consists of two parts , an artificial nephron that filters metabolic waste and water from the blood and an artificial renal tubule that returns to the blood the useful ingredients in primary urine , such as water and amino acids .</seg>
<seg id="330">both the " artificial nephron " and the " artificial renal tubule " are made of hollow fibers . in addition , the interior of the artificial renal tubule is fully lined with renal tubular epithelial cells which have the ability to decompose metabolic waste .</seg>
<seg id="331">the epithelial cells can decompose the causative substance of dialysis @-@ related amyloidosis , a disease caused by repeated hemodialysis , into amino acids and return them to the blood while reabsorbing into the blood the glucose , vitamins , and minerals the body needs .</seg>
<seg id="332">in contrast , previous artificial kidneys , depending on the difference of osmotic pressures to filter metabolic waste , were unable to remove that completely and nor did they have the ability to return ingredients such as amino acids to the blood .</seg>

<seg id="337">xinhua news agency , beijing , feb. 13 ( correspondent an bei ) a senior official from the state electricity regulatory commission said on the 13 th that although power production safety remained generally stable in 2005 , safe power production still faces serious challenges .</seg>
<seg id="338">at the fifth ( expanded ) meeting of the national commission for safe power production held here , serc vice chairman shi yubo said that in 2005 china 's power production safety was generally stable , while power supply during the peak summer season was successfully and safely accomplished . active efforts were made to cope with the effects of natural disasters , and the safe and stable operation of the power supply system was basically ensured . accidents involving power production safety infrastructure as well as general power grid accidents were significantly reduced on a year @-@ on @-@ year basis , and the physical condition of power supply infrastructure was improved .</seg>
<seg id="339">nevertheless , he noted that along with changes in the power supply and demand situation and the operation of a large number of newly @-@ built power generator units added in succession , safe power production will face new challenges .</seg>
<seg id="340">included in these challenges are : regional , seasonal , and periodic power shortages will continue to exist ; the power supply and demand situation in some regions will remain quite tight ; the lack of a good mechanism for coal pricing for power generation will continue to result in relatively big coal supply problems , while at the same time , the lack of effective control over the declining quality of coal will produce serious impact on the stable operation of power generator units ; some weakly structured parts of power grids and outdated equipment may pose hidden hazards to the safety of the system ; and the frequency of accidents in power infrastructure construction has yet to be brought under control , with the situation remaining grim .</seg>
<seg id="341">shi yubo said that with the deepening of electricity system reform , many contradictions at deep levels will continue to emerge . how to maintain a stable working staff and ensure normal production order will become new problems .</seg>
<seg id="342">with regard to power production safety work in 2006 , shi yubo said that efforts should be made to further strengthen the basic administration of power production safety ; accelerate the establishment and improvement of administrative mechanisms for power safety emergencies ; enhance capabilities for handling emergencies ; step up coordination and cooperation among power producers and power grids so as to jointly maintain power system safety ; continue to effectively supervise dam safety for hydro @-@ electric power stations and to work on developing information networks to ensure dam safety ; strengthen safety supervision in power infrastructure construction to reduce accidents resulting in casualties ; and continue to enhance information reporting and notification to ensure the accurate and timely flow of power safety information .</seg>
<seg id="343">it was learned that in connection with the new power safety administration situation , this year the serc will carry out revision and improvement of the provisional regulations on investigation of power production accidents that were issued . meanwhile , supplementary documents concerning dam safety for hydro @-@ electric power stations and protection of secondary power systems will be released in succession for implementation this year .</seg>
<seg id="344">in 2005 , electricity consumption by all sectors in china reached 2,468.9 gigawatt @-@ hours , up 13.45 % year @-@ on @-@ year .</seg>

<seg id="364">currently , some 200,000 chinese nationals live in towns and rural areas across south africa .</seg>
<seg id="365">analysts here attribute the high crime rate to the large gap between the rich and the poor , high unemployment rate , rampant use of guns , and lack of death penalty in south africa .</seg>

<seg id="563">although italy has said repeatedly that all athletes found using stimulants during the turin winter olympics may face " prison sentences , " based on various circumstances at this time , such fate is unlikely to happen to russian biathlete olga pyleva , the center of the first stimulant scandal at this winter olympics .</seg>
<seg id="564">on the 16 th , the first stimulant scandal broke out at the turin winter olympics when olga pyleva was found to have used carphedon , a banned drug .</seg>
<seg id="565">the next day the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had been expelled from the winter olympics . in addition , she was stripped of the individual biathlon silver medal for women 's 15 km event she won at this winter olympics .</seg>
<seg id="566">on the same day , the international biathlon union decided to give pyleva a two @-@ year ban from the competition .</seg>
<seg id="567">it has always been the ioc regulation that athletes found using stimulants at the olympic games be subject to revocation of their achievements and the eligibility to compete , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .</seg>
<seg id="568">however , under italian law , athletes ' carrying and using stimulants are considered criminal acts . prosecution agencies have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes on stimulants , and violators also face a prison sentence of between three months and three years .</seg>
<seg id="569">in december last year , after " bargaining " for a year , the ioc and the italian government finally reached an agreement , under which the two sides will deal with cases of athletes using stimulants at this winter olympics in accordance with the italian law .</seg>
<seg id="570">through the untiring efforts of the ioc , the italian side made concession four days before the winter olympics opened , promising that police would not enter the olympic village to raid athletes ' quarters during the winter olympics , but athletes tested positive for drugs are still subject to investigations of italian prosecutors .</seg>

<seg id="575">shi kangcheng said that the ioc and the italian government have never " thoroughly resolved " the anti @-@ stimulant issue at the winter olympics . even if the italian prosecution agency really gets involved in this case , the outcome is still hard to tell .</seg>
<seg id="576">based on italy 's penalties on its own athletes in the previous cases of stimulant abuse , the maximum penalties violators got were only " two @-@ year deferred imprisonment . "</seg>

<seg id="168">china 's experts : " china 's military threat " touted by the united states is an unreasonable accusation .</seg>
<seg id="169">xinhua news agency , beijing , february 9 ( reporters : li xuanliang , xiong zhengyan , lin liping ) . the quadrennial defense review formally submitted by the united states pentagon to the congress a few days ago first calls china " a newly arisen power that is most likely to challenge the united states militarily . "</seg>
<seg id="170">experts think that this is an unreasonable accusation against china 's normal defense construction , and an interference in china 's internal affairs by exaggerating the " theory of china 's military threat . "</seg>
<seg id="171">the quadrennial defense review is a new guidance document for national defense of the pentagon .</seg>
<seg id="172">this 92 @-@ page report uses three paragraphs to discuss the issue of china 's military strength and how the united states should cope with it . the report directly mentions the two terms of " china " and " chinese " 15 times , and says that , " as a major newly arisen power , china has the most military potential to compete with the united states ; if the united states does not take any countermeasures , china is very likely to develop destructive military technology , and break the us supremacy of traditional weapons . "</seg>
<seg id="173">yao yunzhu , a research fellow at the world 's military study office of china 's military science academy , said that although senior us officials expressed similar views before , this is the first time for the united states to come up with the idea that " china is most likely to challenge the united states militarily as a newly arisen power " in a defense strategy report .</seg>
<seg id="174">" this report first regards russia , india , and china as newly arisen strategic rivals , and especially , pays more attention to the so @-@ called ' theory of china 's military threat , ' "</seg>
<seg id="175">said major general peng guangqian , a research fellow at china 's military science academy .</seg>
<seg id="176">the noticeable thing is that on the same day when the quadrennial defense review was submitted , us president bush also presented his administrative budget for the 2007 fiscal year to the congress , and the defense budget is as high as 439.3 billion dollars in the budget .</seg>
<seg id="177">" if the budget for military activities in iraq and afghanistan is added , the defense budget for the us in the 2007 fiscal year will break the historical record of 500 billion dollars , " said peng guangqian . " and this almost amounts to the sum of military expenses of all the countries in the world . "</seg>
<seg id="178">peng guangqian thinks that the us method of making " theories of threats from other countries " reflects its consistent style of " making enemies , " and its real goal is to strive for more defense funds and fish for more profits for the us 's gigantic defense industry groups .</seg>
<seg id="179">experts said that compared with the large military expenses of the us , china 's military expenditure is quite limited .</seg>
<seg id="180">deng hongzhou , a military expert who has participated in the writing of the china defense white paper many times , said that since the 90 s of the 20 th century , with the economic development , china 's defense funding has been increased to some extent , but it tends to fall in its ratio to the state 's financial expenditure in the same periods .</seg>
<seg id="181">official data shows that comparing 2004 with 1979 , the ratio of china 's defense expenditure in the state 's financial expenditure was decreased nearly 10 percentage points .</seg>
<seg id="182">china 's defense funding in 2005 was rmb 244.656 billion yuan , which only amounts to 1 @/@ 14 of that of the us ; military expense per capita is only equal to 1 @/@ 60 of that of the us ; and military expense per serviceman is about only 1 @/@ 30 of that of the us armed forces .</seg>
<seg id="183">" the us land area is about as big as china 's , but the gap in military expenditures between ( the two countries ) is so huge that there is no need to point out whose military strength indeed exceeds the needs of a justifiable defense , "</seg>
<seg id="184">said peng guangqian .</seg>
<seg id="185">teng jianqun , director of the study office at china 's armament control and disarmament association , said that the us side should objectively comment on china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military rivals in the future .</seg>
<seg id="186">china 's defense white paper 2004 says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and implements a defensive policy of national defense .</seg>
<seg id="187">china never threatened or threatens or will threaten any countries .</seg>
<seg id="188">china has never established any military bases in any other countries so far , nor sent any troops to other countries ; but the united states has established more than a hundred overseas military bases , and deployed more than 100,000 troops in the asian region alone .</seg>
<seg id="189">zhu feng , a professor at the international relations college of beijing university , said that both china and the united states should strengthen communications and exchanges through established channels between the two countries to promote understanding and mutual trust , thoroughly advance the constructive collaboration relation between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly develop and maintain peace and development in the world .</seg>

<seg id="209">xinhua news agency , ramallah , february 9 ( international observation ) . hamas seeks breakthrough in organization of its cabinet</seg>
<seg id="210">xinhua news agency reporters : wang hao and huang min</seg>
<seg id="211">how the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) draws the blueprint for its first government after it won the legislative committee election has become the focus that the international community is currently paying attention to .</seg>
<seg id="212">what kind of a new policy hamas is going to carry out will directly affect the next appropriate policy direction of every party concerned in the peace process .</seg>
<seg id="213">at the same time , the boycott attitude of the united states and israel has made the prospect of the hamas government more uncertain .</seg>
<seg id="214">currently , all the parties in palestine are consulting each other tensely , and actively looking for breakthroughs in difficulties and sensitive aspects in future development of the cabinet organization .</seg>
<seg id="215">( subtitle ) who will be selected to take the position of prime minister ?</seg>
<seg id="216">some outsiders worry that a " hamas prime minister " might have disagreements with abbas , the current supreme leader , after hamas wins the right to organize its cabinet .</seg>
<seg id="217">moreover , a hamas leader , mushir , who is visiting egypt , stressed that a new palestinian government established by hamas leadership will not acknowledge israel . this strong signal has also raised more international concerns .</seg>
<seg id="218">the united states and israel have clearly stated that they do not accept a hamas government that controls real power , and threatened to stop their economic aid to palestine and suspend transferring tax income to the palestinian side .</seg>
<seg id="219">however , these things do not hinder hamas from adjusting its strategy flexibly . selection of an independent candidate is one compromise .</seg>
<seg id="220">as it has been reported , to win maximum acknowledgement internationally , the hamas leaders from home and abroad who gathered in egypt a few days ago , had decided to select jamal al @-@ khudairi , an independent person who is the chair of the board of gaza islamic university , to be the new prime minister .</seg>
<seg id="221">this move has not been responded to by related parties .</seg>
<seg id="222">hussein , a palestinian analyst , said that no matter who is selected as the prime minister , the most important thing is to soften the " strong " attitude of hamas as much as possible on the selection of the candidate for prime minister , and only in this way can it assure the success of the cabinet organization .</seg>
<seg id="223">( subtitle ) how to allocate power</seg>
<seg id="224">the biggest challenge for hamas in organizing its cabinet is that it lacks sufficient administrative experience from the perspective of its internal capabilities .</seg>
<seg id="225">an article published by the palestinian daily journal analyzed that although hamas has won support from people through social welfare items , it lacks administrative experience , and a better strategy is to collaborate with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has administrative experience .</seg>
<seg id="226">hamas suggested to establish a " political partnership " with fatah to organize a national coalition government after the election , but fatah has not actively responded to it so far .</seg>
<seg id="227">inside fatah , there are now different opinions on whether it should join the cabinet ; some think it should join the new government to play a role in it ; some refuse the invitation from hamas and would rather become an " active opposition " in the legislative committee .</seg>
<seg id="228">a well @-@ informed source pointed out that fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government after abbas 's persuasion .</seg>
<seg id="229">even so , fatah will bargain with hamas on the allocation of cabinet positions .</seg>
<seg id="230">moreover , another path is to establish a cabinet that is out of the framework of the legislative committee and free of partisan leanings .</seg>
<seg id="231">as it has been reported , hamas has also designed a pure technocratic government , but the concrete name list of the government is unknown .</seg>
<seg id="232">because of the attitude of the united states and israel , a technocratic government is a cabinet organization method that can reduce external pressure .</seg>
<seg id="233">according to regulations of the palestinian " essential law , " nomination of the prime minister and the cabinet organization work will be completed within 3 to 5 weeks after a new legislative committee assumes office on the 16 th of this month .</seg>
<seg id="234">( subtitle ) where does the armed wing go ?</seg>
<seg id="235">another difficult issue for organization of a new government is the weapons in the hands of hamas .</seg>
<seg id="236">the attitude of the united states and israel is very strong , and they firmly request that hamas give up violence , and refuse its joining the government with its weapons .</seg>
<seg id="237">hamas leader mushir stressed on the 9 th that the armed resistance is the " strategic choice " of the organization .</seg>
<seg id="238">the armed wing issue includes two aspects of weapons ' legitimacy and ownership and control of armed wings .</seg>
<seg id="239">hamas is acknowledged internationally because it becomes the first big party elected in the legislative committee through a democratic and free method , and the legitimatized path for its armed wing , the qassam brigades , is to integrate it into a security organization for the government .</seg>
<seg id="240">hamas used to suggest integrating military wings of all factions into a " people 's army " under the palestinian national authority , but it has not received broad responses , and has even been criticized by the palestinian islamic organization ( jihad ) .</seg>
<seg id="241">palestine currently has more than 60,000 personnel in security organizations , and most of them come from the fatah camp .</seg>
<seg id="242">moreover , fatah has some armed wings and keeps loose organizational relations with them , such as the " al @-@ aqsa martyr brigades " and " fatah hawks , " etc.</seg>
<seg id="243">hamas , responsible for the cabinet organization , must make an agreement with abbas on how to control those self @-@ governed armed wings and reasonably allocate security and administrative power .</seg>
<seg id="244">as local media reported , abbas tends to control security and intelligence troops ; organizations such as the police and civilian defense can be administrated by the internal affairs ministry of a new government .</seg>
<seg id="245">however , all parties concerned are still consulting each other on this sensitive issue , and have not produced any results .</seg>

<seg id="365">analysts here think that since there are big gaps between the rich and poor in south african society , and a high unemployment rate , guns are spread everywhere , and no death penalty , the crime rate is still high there .</seg>

<seg id="563">although italy reiterated that any athletes who are discovered using stimulants may face the " disaster of being jailed , " many cases currently demonstrate that it is unlikely to happen to russian women 's biathlon athlete olga pyleva , who is at the center of the first scandal over stimulant use at the winter olympic games .</seg>
<seg id="564">the first stimulant use scandal at the turin winter olympic games was exposed on the 16 th , and olga pyleva was discovered to have used the illegal and banned drug carphedon .</seg>
<seg id="565">the next day , the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had been thrown out of the winter olympic games , and the silver medal she won for the 15 km women 's biathlon had been withdrawn .</seg>
<seg id="566">the same day , the international winter biathlon alliance determined to forbid pyleva to participate in the sport for two years .</seg>
<seg id="567">the international olympic committee has been implementing the regulation that once athletes are discovered using stimulants , they will lose their qualification to participate in the games , and the scores they achieved will be withdrawn , but they are not subject to legal punishment .</seg>
<seg id="568">however , according to italian law , the carrying and use of stimulants by any athlete are criminal activities . a law enforcement organization has the right to directly arrest and investigate any athlete who uses stimulants . any violators of the law are subject to jail for 3 months to 3 years .</seg>
<seg id="569">the international olympic committee had been " bargaining " with the italian government for one year , and eventually reached an agreement last december . both sides agreed that during the period of the winter olympic games , any athletes who use stimulants would be handled according to italian laws .</seg>
<seg id="570">through the unremitting efforts made by the international olympic committee , the italian side made a compromise four days before the opening ceremonies of the winter olympic games , and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to search athlete residences during the olympic games . but any athletes whose drug tests show positive will be investigated by italian prosecution organizations .</seg>
<seg id="571">some reports said that pescante , an official of the italian government responsible for supervision of the turin winter olympic games , has transferred pyleva 's stimulant case to a turin prosecution organization .</seg>

<seg id="573">andrey dmytriev , a doctor for the russian biathlon team , disclosed at noontime on the 17 th that pyleva had left turin and returned home .</seg>
<seg id="574">shi kangcheng , a chinese sports official who had been in a position at the world anti @-@ stimulant organization for many years , thinks that once pyleva returns home , this case might eventually " be settled by leaving it unsettled . "</seg>
<seg id="575">shi kangcheng said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have not " completely addressed " the anti @-@ stimulant issue at the winter olympic games , and it is hard to say what the outcome would be even if italian prosecution organizations really did get involved in the case .</seg>
<seg id="576">based on past penalty cases in which italy sentenced or punished its own athletes who used stimulants , the most serious penalty was merely a " two @-@ year probation . "</seg>
<seg id="577">thus , senior reporter piali from the italian ansa said that the possibility of pyleva being jailed is " very small , " and at most , she might be fined .</seg>
<seg id="578">piali also said that although an italian court could sentence her by default , it is impossible for the italian police to catch pyleva abroad and bring her back to serve the sentence .</seg>

<seg id="95">( newspaper excerpt）shanghai : part @-@ timers and university grads become main source of hourly workers .</seg>
<seg id="96">beijing , feb. 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai bureau of labor and social security released on the 6 th the " 2006 most recent guidance for hourly wages " . it covers 120 kinds of positions -- 11 more than the last edition -- and reveals that wages for certain positions previously covered have risen in some cases and fallen in others .</seg>
<seg id="97">according to estimates by experts at the shanghai bureau of labor and social security , the number of hourly workers now exceeds one million .</seg>
<seg id="98">china youth daily has reported that university graduates and part @-@ timers are the main source of hourly workers .</seg>
<seg id="99">results of a direct survey of nearly 8000 hourly workers show that more than half are part @-@ timers , with the percentage reaching 51.1 % .</seg>
<seg id="100">the educational level of these part @-@ timers is generally high , with most engaged in highly technical labor such as translation work , in which part @-@ timers make up 81.7 % of the manpower . in the fitness industry , they occupy up to 61.6 % of the positions .</seg>
<seg id="101">high income is one of the main reasons many people do hourly part @-@ time work .</seg>
<seg id="102">according to sources , the monthly income from some positions can be in the tens of thousands of yuan with manpower still being in short supply . simultaneous interpretation is one such example . the monthly income for most hourly positions -- such as part @-@ time accountants and wedding masters of ceremony -- can reach 2000 yuan or more .</seg>
<seg id="103">another important reason that hourly part @-@ time work has become popular is the desire to satisfy personal interest and expand one 's knowledge .</seg>
<seg id="104">for example , mr. gu , manager of an enterprise 's human resources department , spends several hours each week processing financial accounts for the representative office of a foreign company .</seg>
<seg id="105">mr. gu says the greatest benefits of part @-@ time work are the continuous upgrading of one 's knowledge and the opportunity to dabble in a different field . of course , the 2000 yuan in monthly income is also attractive .</seg>
<seg id="106">because some hourly positions have a low threshold and flexible work arrangements , they are gradually finding favor with many job @-@ seeking graduates . fourteen percent of hourly workers graduated from university or technical schools in the last three years .</seg>
<seg id="107">" initially , i wasn't interested in hourly work . but after a few months , i feel that it is better than a nine @-@ to @-@ five job . "</seg>
<seg id="108">after young huang graduated from university , he could not find a job he liked . finally , he signed up at a hotel to play background music on a piano .</seg>
<seg id="109">" at 100 yuan an hour and with the good environment , i am very satisfied with my job . what i need now is to find more hourly jobs . "</seg>
<seg id="110">according to reports , hourly jobs have become an important route for job @-@ hunting graduates to accumulate work experience , hone their work skills , improve their communication skills and gain increased social experience .</seg>
<seg id="111">graduates doing hourly work are mostly concentrated in positions requiring a high level of knowledge and skills , such as highly specialized translating positions and positions involving highly contemporary art or entertainment work . these two fields account for 22.1 % and 26.8 % respectively .</seg>
<seg id="112">some hourly positions , such as foodstuff salespersons and shipping clerks , do not require a high level of skill and can be filled by unemployed persons following some simple training .</seg>
<seg id="113">data shows that the unemployed make up 39 % of hourly workers . the proportion of unemployed workers is as high as 68.4 % in retail @-@ related positions and 58.7 % in catering @-@ related positions . hourly work has become an important path to employment for the unemployed .</seg>

"</seg>
<seg id="170">experts say this is unreasonable finger @-@ pointing at china 's normal defense construction , an exaggeration of the " chinese military threat " and an interference in china 's internal affairs .</seg>
<seg id="171">the quadrennial defense review is the pentagon 's new national defense guidelines .</seg>
<seg id="172">the 92 @-@ page report devotes three paragraphs to the issue of china 's military and the countermeasures the united states should take . the report makes 15 direct references to " china " or " chinese " and says that " as an important emerging power , china has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the united states . if the united states fails to take countermeasures , china will very likely field disruptive military technologies that could offset traditional u.s. military advantages " .</seg>
<seg id="173">yao yunzhu , researcher with the department of world military research at the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints on various earlier occasions , this is the first time that the us has said in the defense report that " china is the major emerging power that has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the united states " .</seg>

<seg id="176">worthy of note is that on the same day the quadrennial defense review was officially submitted , us president bush also submitted the government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to congress . it included us $ 439.3 bn earmarked for national defense .</seg>

<seg id="216">since hamas won the right to form a cabinet , some outsiders have expressed worry that a split could take place between the " hamas prime minister " and the palestinian leader , abbas .</seg>
<seg id="217">in addition , the leader of hamas , mashaal , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that a palestinian government formed by the leaders of hamas would not recognize israel , a hard @-@ line signal that heightened international concern .</seg>
<seg id="218">the us and israel have clearly stated they will not accept a hamas @-@ led government with real power and have threatened to cut off economic aid to palestine and freeze the transfer of tax revenues .</seg>
<seg id="219">but this has not prevented hamas from carrying out some agile strategic adjustments , including a compromise policy of selecting independents .</seg>
<seg id="220">according to reports , in order to maximize recognition from the international community , in recent days overseas and domestic leaders of hamas gathered in egypt decided to select an independent figure , ismail haniyeh , chairman of the board of gaza islamic university , to become the new prime minister .</seg>

<seg id="222">palestinian analyst hisham said that , whoever takes over the prime @-@ ministership , the most important thing is that the person should be capable of toning down hamas ' hard @-@ line character , since only in this way can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed .</seg>
<seg id="223">( subhead ) how will authority be distributed ?</seg>
<seg id="224">from an internal perspective , the biggest challenge faced by the hamas @-@ led cabinet is a lack of adequate experience in power .</seg>
<seg id="225">an analysis in an article in the palestinian daily al @-@ ayyam said that hamas gained popularity through social welfare projects but lacked experience in office . cooperation with the palestinian national liberation movement , or fatah , will be the best solution .</seg>
<seg id="226">after the election , hamas raise the possibility of a " political partnership " with fatah and the joint establishment of a national coalition government , but until now fatah has not given a positive response .</seg>
<seg id="227">fatah is internally split regarding whether to participate in the cabinet . one faction advocates taking part in the new government in order to have some sway ; another faction refuses the invitation by hamas and wants instead to be " an active opposition " in parliament .</seg>
<seg id="228">informed sources say fatah , with persuasion coming from abbas , is gradually leaning toward participating in the new government .</seg>
<seg id="229">even so , hamas and fatah will still haggle over the distribution of cabinet posts .</seg>
<seg id="230">another path would be to establish a cabinet outside the parliamentary framework and ignore party affiliation .</seg>
<seg id="231">according to reports , hamas has also laid out a government composed uniquely of experts , but the actual name list is still unknown .</seg>
<seg id="232">in view of us and israeli attitudes , a government of technical experts is a way of forming a cabinet that will help lighten pressure from outside .</seg>

<seg id="534">beijing , feb. 17 ( xinhua ) ( reporter : liu zheng ) following a string of four mining disasters that took the lives of over one hundred people , the grim status of national production safety over the past year has made " curbing major and extraordinary coal mine accidents " the most urgent task in national work safety this year .</seg>
<seg id="535">this reporter was informed on the 17 th by the state administration of work safety that coal mines must be given top priority if major and extraordinary coal mine accidents are truly going to be curbed .</seg>
<seg id="536">to make coal mines safer this year , the state administration of work safety will take a strong hold over the following three items :</seg>
<seg id="537">-- continue to wage an aggressive fight to control gas .</seg>
<seg id="538">control of gas this year must give prominence to " draining gas before mining coal " .</seg>
<seg id="539">if high gassy mines fail to " drain gas before mining coal " , they will be legally ordered to immediately halt production .</seg>
<seg id="540">-- continue to wage an aggressive fight to consolidate and close mines .</seg>
<seg id="541">the 5243 coal @-@ mine and coal @-@ pit closures already announced to the public must be carried out one by one , as must the more than seven hundred other closures recently announced in various regions .</seg>
<seg id="542">closures must become a part of routine work , with coal mines that destroy resources , pollute the environment and fail to meet safety requirements being shut down without relent .</seg>
<seg id="543">-- strengthen administration of coal @-@ mine safety infrastructure .</seg>
<seg id="544">the deterioration of management in the small number of large state @-@ owned mines must immediately be corrected and controlled , while small mines with disorganized management should be guided in the building of standardized safety management systems .</seg>
<seg id="545">in particular , key state @-@ owned mines should be tightly controlled in order to strictly prohibit production in excess of capacity , strength or manpower .</seg>
<seg id="546">the safe production control standard for this year calls for a 3 % drop over last year in the number of deaths nationally from all types of accidents , including a 3.5 % drop in accidents in coal mines .</seg>
<seg id="547">major accidents with a death toll higher than ten must decrease at least 5 % , while in the coal mines they must decrease 7 % .</seg>
<seg id="548">these control standards have been transmitted to the people 's governments of the various provinces . the various regions are breaking them up into their various layers and implementing them at the grassroots and enterprise levels .</seg>
<seg id="549">statistics show that nationally 5986 people were killed in coal mine accidents in 2005 , which represents a 0.7 % decrease year on year .</seg>
<seg id="550">but there were more large accidents in which ten or more people were killed , with the number of deaths increasing 66.6 % year on year .</seg>

<seg id="564">on the 16 th , the turin winter olympics saw its first doping scandal uncovered when olga pyleva was found to have used carphedron , a banned drug .</seg>
<seg id="565">the following day , the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had been expelled from the winter olympics and stripped of the silver medal she won for the women 's 15 km individual biathlon at these winter olympics .</seg>
<seg id="566">the same day , the international winter biathlon union decided to ban her from competition for two years .</seg>
<seg id="567">it has been a consistent rule of the international olympic committee that any athlete found to have used performance @-@ enhancing drugs at an olympics games will have his or her result cancelled and be disqualified from participation , but will receive no legal penalty .</seg>
<seg id="568">but under italian law , athletes commit a crime by carrying and using stimulants . judicial authorities have the power to directly arrest and investigate all athletes that use performance @-@ enhancing drugs and punish violators with prison terms ranging from three months to three years .</seg>
<seg id="569">in december last year , after one year of " bargaining " , the international olympic committee and the italian government finally reached an accord under which the two sides agreed to handle incidents involving doping athletes during this winter olympics in accordance with italian laws .</seg>
<seg id="570">following unremitting efforts by the international olympic committee , italian authorities conceded four days before the opening of the winter olympics to a promise that police would not enter the olympic village to search athletes ' dwellings during the winter olympic games . but athletes whose drug test proves positive will still be subject to investigation by italian prosecutors .</seg>

<seg id="576">based on past instances of punishment handed down to italian athletes that have used performance @-@ enhancing drugs , the harshest punishment imposed on violators was no more than " two years of prison term served on probation " .</seg>
<seg id="577">for this reason , senior reporter of italy 's ansa [ pei ai ] predicted that the possibility of pyleva going to prison was " exceedingly slim " and that a fine would be the most she would receive .</seg>
<seg id="578">also said that although an italian court can pass judgment in absentia , it would be impossible for the italian police to bring her back from a foreign country for a prison term .</seg>

<seg id="95">( selected best of newspapers and periodicals ) shanghai : persons with concurrent jobs and graduates of institutions of higher education become main force of hourly wage earners .</seg>
<seg id="96">xinhua news february 7 from beijing . shanghai municipal ministry of labor and social security announced its ' guide to minimum hourly wages for 2006 ' on february 6 . the number of jobs covered reached 120 , 11 more than last time . wages for these jobs saw some increases and some decreases .</seg>
<seg id="97">according to the estimations of relevant experts at the shanghai municipal ministry of labor and social security , shanghai already has over one million people who work for hourly wages .</seg>
<seg id="98">according to a report in " china youth magazine , " graduates from institutions of higher education and people holding concurrent jobs ( holding two or more jobs at once ) are the main constituencies making up the ranks that work for hourly wages .</seg>
<seg id="99">through direct surveying of nearly 8000 hourly paying jobs , it was found that over half of those surveyed hold concurrent jobs . the proportion of this group reaches 51.1 % of the whole .</seg>
<seg id="100">the level of culture of concurrent job holders is usually fairly high , they mainly are employed in jobs with relatively strong technical natures , such as translation positions where the proportion of concurrent laborers is as high as 81.7 % , and fitness areas where the proportion reaches 61.6 % .</seg>
<seg id="101">a high income is one important reason that many people are engaged in concurrent hourly paying jobs .</seg>
<seg id="102">according to our understanding , some positions have monthly incomes that can reach several tens of thousands of rmb , such as some hard to fill positions like simultaneous interpretation . the majority of hourly positions have monthly incomes reaching 2000 rmb or more , such as those concurrent positions in financial affairs , wedding masters of ceremonies , and so on .</seg>
<seg id="103">satisfying personal interests and expanding one 's knowledge is also an important reason that receives the attention of those holding concurrent jobs with hourly wages .</seg>
<seg id="104">for example , mr. gu , who holds the position of manager of the human resources department of a certain enterprise , will take a few hours of time every week to handle the financial accounts of the representative office of a certain foreign business .</seg>
<seg id="105">mr. gu believes that the biggest benefit of concurrent jobs is that it allows his knowledge to continually receive updates , and he has opportunities to be involved in another area . of course , a monthly income of 2000 rmb also has a certain attraction .</seg>
<seg id="106">because some hourly positions have low employment thresholds , the circumstances of the jobs are flexible and free and have progressively received the attention of many graduates currently looking for positions . among those making hourly wages , 14 % are university or technical school graduates of the past three years .</seg>
<seg id="107">" at first i didn't want to work for hourly wages , but after a few months , i think it 's better than going to work from nine to five . "</seg>
<seg id="108">after college student huang graduated , the job she found wasn't very ideal . finally she registered her name with a hotel to play background music on the piano .</seg>
<seg id="109">" i am very satisfied with my current job . i make 100 rmb an hour , and the environment is good , what i want to do now is find more hourly wage jobs . "</seg>
<seg id="110">according to our understanding , hourly wage work has already become an important path for graduates to accumulate work experience , exercise their working skills , increase their communication techniques , and grow social experiences .</seg>
<seg id="111">graduates doing hourly work are mainly concentrated on positions with relatively strong technical and intellectual natures , such as translation positions and similar positions with relatively high professional natures and highly era @-@ stylistic performance art positions . their proportion of hourly wages is 22.1 % and 26.8 % respectively .</seg>
<seg id="112">some hourly work positions have lower technical skills , such as food sales promoter and tally clerks . unemployed persons can begin working these positions with only simple training .</seg>
<seg id="113">the data shows that the proportion of people working hourly wage jobs that were originally unemployed reaches 39 % , among which retail jobs have a proportion as high as 68.4 % of workers that were unemployed , and a proportion of 58.7 % among food and beverage jobs . hourly wage jobs have become an important channel for the unemployed .</seg>

<seg id="168">chinese expert : america beating drum of ' chinese military threat ' is irrational criticism</seg>
<seg id="169">xinhua new february 9 from beijing ( reporters li xuanliang , xiong zhengyan , and lin liping ) the pentagon 's " quadrennial defense review report " formally handed over to congress in recent days has for the first time referred to china as ' the newly rising major nation most likely to present a military challenge to america' .</seg>
<seg id="170">experts believe this is an irrational criticism of china 's normal defense construction , a dramatization of the ' chinese military threat theory' , and is an interference in china 's internal affairs .</seg>
<seg id="171">the " quadrennial defense review report " is the pentagon 's new national defense policy paper .</seg>
<seg id="172">this 92 page long report uses three sections to discuss the problem of chinese military force and what paths america should take to meet this problem . the report directly brings up ' china ' or ' chinese ' a total of 15 times , saying ' as a major and newly prosperous large nation , china has the most potential to carry out military competition with america . if america does not have counter @-@ measures , china will likely develop destructive military technologies , thus breaking america 's advantage in conventional weapons . '</seg>
<seg id="173">researcher yao yunzhu of the world military research department of the china military science institute says that , although high level american officials have expressed similar views many times before , this is the first time america put forward that ' china is the newly rising major country most likely to present a military challenge to america ' in its ' defense strategy reports' .</seg>
<seg id="174">' this report for the first time clearly takes russia , india , and china as newly rising strategic opponents , among which it especially gives even more consideration to the so called chinese military threat theory . '</seg>
<seg id="175">said major general peng guangqian , researcher of the china military science institute .</seg>
<seg id="176">worth noting is that on the same day that the " quadrennial defense review report " was formally handed in , american president bush also handed to congress the government budget for fiscal year 2007 , in which the defense budget reached 439.3 billion usd .</seg>
<seg id="177">' if you add on to this the budget for the military movements in iraq and afghanistan , america 's 2007 fiscal year defense budget will breakthrough 500 billion usd , setting a new historic high ' peng guangqian said . ' this is nearly equal to the total military expenditures of all other countries in the world put together . '</seg>
<seg id="178">peng guangqian believes that the method of america concocting ' threat theories from other countries ' reflects the pentagon 's usual style of ' creating enemies . ' its real aim is in striving for even more defense expenditures , and dredging up even more profits for america 's huge military industrial complex .</seg>
<seg id="179">experts say , compared with america 's huge military expenditures , china 's defense expenditures are relatively limited .</seg>
<seg id="180">military expert deng hongzhou , who has taken part in the writing of china 's defense white paper several times , said that since the 1990 's , along with economic development , china 's defense expenditures have increased , but have shown a declining trend in the total proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period .</seg>
<seg id="181">official data shows that in 2004 as compared to 1979 , china 's defense expenditures fell by ten percentage points in terms of the proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period .</seg>
<seg id="182">in 2005 , china 's defense expenditures were 244.656 billion rmb , equal to only approximately 1 @/@ 14 of america 's . average per capita military expenditures are only equal to about 1 @/@ 60 of america 's . per capita spending on military personnel is only equal to approximately 1 @/@ 30 of america 's .</seg>
<seg id="183">' america 's land area is about equal to china 's land area , but military expenditures of the two countries have a huge difference . it is self evident which country has military strength that exceeds its normal defense needs . '</seg>
<seg id="184">peng guangqian said .</seg>
<seg id="185">teng jianqun , director of the research department of china 's military control and disarmament association , expressed that america should objectively appraise the situation of china 's military construction . china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and america will become military opponents in the future .</seg>
<seg id="186">the " china 's defense in 2004 " white paper said china staunchly follows the path of peaceful development , and carries out a defensive national defense policy .</seg>
<seg id="187">china has never become a threat to any country in the past or present , and will not become a threat in the future .</seg>
<seg id="188">up until now , china has not established military bases in any country , and has not sent one soldier to any other country , while america has over 100 military bases abroad , and in the asian pacific region alone has in excess of 100,000 military forces deployed .</seg>
<seg id="189">professor zhu feng of beijing university 's international relations institute said that china and america should go through already established channels to increase communication and exchanges , increase understanding and mutual trust , comprehensively further chinese and american constructive cooperative relations in the new century and jointly promote maintaining world peace and development .</seg>

<seg id="209">xinhua news february 9 from ramallah ( internationl observation ) . hamas looks for breakthrough in forming cabinet</seg>
<seg id="210">xinhua news reporter hao huangmin</seg>
<seg id="211">after the palestine islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) obtained victory in legislative elections , how it will paint a blueprint for a new government has become a focal point the whole world is concerned with at the moment .</seg>
<seg id="212">what kinds of new policies hamas will put forth will directly influence the direction taken by all concerned parties in corresponding policy for the peace process .</seg>
<seg id="213">at the same time , the attitude of resistance of america and israel adds even more variables to the prospects of the hamas government .</seg>
<seg id="214">at present , various palestinian factions are currently tightening their cooperation , and are actively searching for breakthroughs on the future development of the situation on sensitive points and difficulties that forming a cabinet involves .</seg>
<seg id="215">( sub heading ) who will the position of premier fall to ?</seg>
<seg id="216">after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , there have been people in the outside world who worry a ' hamas premier ' will likely see differently than the current high leader abbas .</seg>
<seg id="217">also , hamas leader mashal , who is currently visiting egypt , emphasized that the new palestinian government established by hamas leaders will not continue to recognize israel . this intransigent standpoint also intensifies the worry of the international community .</seg>
<seg id="218">america and israel explicitly state they will not accept a hamas government that controls real power , and have used this threat to cut off economic support and transmission of taxation to palestine .</seg>
<seg id="219">however , this has not obstructed hamas in making flexible policy adjustments - choosing independents is a policy to split the difference .</seg>
<seg id="220">according to reports , to acquire international approval across the largest range possible , earlier domestic and foreign hamas leaders meeting together in egypt decided to choose independent ismail haniyeh , chairman of the board of trustees of the islamic university in gaza , to be appointed the new premier .</seg>
<seg id="221">this move has still not received the responses of concerned parties .</seg>
<seg id="222">palestine analyst hussein said that no matter who the position of premier falls to , what is most crucial is the choice for premier must dilute the ' hard ' aspects of hamas as much as possible . only by doing this can the successful forming of a cabinet be secured .</seg>
<seg id="223">( sub heading ) how to allocate power</seg>
<seg id="224">looking at the internal makeup of the party , the biggest challenge that hamas faces in forming a cabinet is it lacks ample experience being in power .</seg>
<seg id="225">the palestine " daily " published an analysis saying that while hamas gathered popularity through social welfare projects , in the area of being in power it lacks experience . hamas cooperating with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has experience being in power , would be the best strategy .</seg>
<seg id="226">hamas brought up establishing a ' government partner ' relationship with fatah after the elections to jointly establish a united ethnic government , however fatah has not given a positive response to this as of the present .</seg>
<seg id="227">opinions among those in the fatah party as to whether or not to enter the cabinet are not the same . one faction advocates participating in the new government , and thus having something to say ; another faction refuses the invitation of hamas , and would rather be an ' active opposition faction ' in the legislature .</seg>
<seg id="228">persons with sensitive information pointed out that under the advice of abbas , fatah is progressively leaning towards entering into the new government .</seg>
<seg id="229">although this might be the case , hamas and fatah would still haggle over the allocation of cabinet positions .</seg>
<seg id="230">besides this , another path would be to establish a cabinet that is free of party affiliations and outside the framework of the legislature .</seg>
<seg id="231">according to reports , hamas has also designed a technocracy government , but the concrete list of names is still unknown .</seg>
<seg id="232">in light of the attitude of israel and america , a technocracy government might still be accepted as a method to form a cabinet that would lessen outside pressure .</seg>
<seg id="233">according to regulations of the palestine " basic law , " after the new legislature convenes on the february 16 , the nominations for premier and forming of a cabinet will be completed in three to five weeks .</seg>
<seg id="234">( sub heading ) at a loss about armed forces</seg>
<seg id="235">the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thorny problem that the forming of a new government faces .</seg>
<seg id="236">america 's and israel 's attitude is extremely stiff . they staunchly demand hamas give up violence , and reject hamas taking part in government while carrying guns .</seg>
<seg id="237">hamas leader mashal emphasized on february 9 that armed resistance is the ' strategic choice ' of his organization .</seg>
<seg id="238">the arms problem in actuality includes two levels of problems : the legality of weapons , and the jurisdiction and management of armed forces .</seg>
<seg id="239">hamas has obtained international acknowledgement for being the largest party in the legislature elected in a democratic and free manner , allowing its subordinate armed faction the ' qawasameh tribe ' to use legal avenues to unify itself into the government 's security organizations .</seg>
<seg id="240">hamas once brought up unifying all armed factions into a palestine ethnic power organization ' people 's army . ' however it did not get a broad response , and also took criticism from the palestinian islamic jihad movement .</seg>
<seg id="241">at present , palestine has over 60,000 security organization personnel , the vast majority of which come from the fatah camp .</seg>
<seg id="242">also , fatah has some subordinate armed factions with loose organizational relations , such as the ' al @-@ aqsa martyrs ' brigades ' and the ' fatah hawks ' and others .</seg>
<seg id="243">hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must come to an understanding with abbas on how to manage these armed forces that each have their own power structures , and allocate the power of management of security in a reasonable way .</seg>
<seg id="244">according to the reports of local media , abbas is interested in managing the security and information regiments , while the police and people 's guard and other organizations will be subordinate to the management of the department of the interior of the new government .</seg>
<seg id="245">however , all sides are still carrying out discussions on this sensitive issue , and as of now there is nothing further .</seg>

<seg id="352">china 's ministry of foreign affairs has already put forward discussion of this to south african parties , and warned chinese citizens traveling in south africa to further strengthen their safety and defense knowledge . overseas compatriots should stick together and coordinate with police to jointly crush criminal behavior .</seg>

<seg id="359">according to the statements from assistant director of tourism manqoba nyembezi of the south african embassy , the embassy sent out over 2000 visas for travel to south africa by chinese in the first 15 days of this year alone .</seg>

<seg id="361">the volume of bilateral trade reached 7.27 billion usd , a year on year growth of 23 % .</seg>
<seg id="362">however , personnel in the tourism field believe that the chinese citizen murders that happened in 2004 will have a clear effect on the number of chinese going to south africa to travel .</seg>
<seg id="363">according to the statistics of the south african tourism bureau , the first half of 2005 saw 20,331 chinese tourists travel to south africa , a drop of 14.9 % with that of the year before .</seg>
<seg id="364">at present there are around 200,000 chinese that live in south africa , spread throughout south africa 's cities , towns , and villages .</seg>
<seg id="365">analysts believe that the disparity between rich and poor in south africa is great , the level of unemployment high , guns are everywhere , and there is no deterrence from a death penalty ; thus the crime rate is high .</seg>
<seg id="366">because many chinese do not understand english but keep cash on their persons and at home , they more easily become targets for criminals looking for money .</seg>
