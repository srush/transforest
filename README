Pipeline: (running example is located at directory ./example)

1) convert a parse tree to a trivial parse forest
EXAMPLE: 
cat short1_parse | ../tree.py --toforest >short1_pforest


2) convert a parse forest into a translation forest

  2.1) filter the rule set and output the rules only used in current parse forest. NOTE: max_height of lhs="(NP (NN c1))" is 2
  cat short1_pforest | ../forest.py --rulefilter t2s.rules -w config.ini --max_height 3 >short1_rules
  
  2.2) convert a parse forest into a translation forest
