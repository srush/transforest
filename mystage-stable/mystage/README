programs that dump forests to output take only one forest a time. programs that only output stuff can take multiple forests at a time
	

multiple forest programs

				main args		output (examples)				
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
forest.py		-k5	--inf		k-best trees (can be \inf-best with threshold)			
oracle.py						forest oracle		

perceptron.py	-T1				weights


single-forest programs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
relative.py		-p10			smaller forest		
local_feat.py	<fclasses>		annotated forest	
dumpdot.py						.dot format: cat 1.forest | dumpdot.py | viewdot.sh


non-forest-based programs:
------------------------------------------------
features.py
readkbest.py
nbest_oracle.py	--



my python programs that reads in the forest (from txt file) and extract features

features.py		definition of features (after Johnson's spfeatures.h)
				
readkbest.py	compute features on kbest list  
		
				cat 1.50best | ../../mystage/readkbest.py -k10 word	rule-1   
				(note 1.50best is in 02train dir)
				question: what's johnson's debug tool? and i did compare them			
				
				cat 1.50best | ../../second-stage/programs/features/best-parses -m 0 rule-1

				note: hacked by me for mode 0. actually should write my own mode 4

				output stuff like 
					379741:2	
				meaning feature id 379741 appears 2 times in this parse-tree. to lookup the feature:
					id2feature modes/f-word "378218:1        379669:1"

forest.py		forest manipulations (readin, prune, kbest, oracle, ...)
				
tree.py			tree class

--------

useful scripts:

scripts/subset		extract a subset of features and weights (say anote.txt)
scripts/id2feature	mapping feature ids to feature
